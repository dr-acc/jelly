# Jelly
Welcome! Jelly is an Elixir learning game featuring the eponymous character "Jelly" and her trusted mount, Bert. 

Jelly is played on a game play area that takes up most of the viewer's browser window. The character: Jelly, riding Bert, can move to most places on the browser window screen using the arrow keys (up, down, right, or left). 
The game board is centered in the game play area. It resembles a tic-tac-toe board and winning a  game entails achieving three marked squares in a row, column, or diagonal. Users can attempt to "mark" a square when it contains the correct answer to the challenge posed in the Instruction Area, located top/front/center, just underneath the site's navbar. 
The Instruction Area poses questions and challenges. These begin with foundational questions, but future development could include a variety of levels and features to encourage learners to work towards higher levels of challenge. 


## Future Directions
To manage project scope, this project was conceptualized as a single game, but additional features could significantly enhance and expand this project in the future, especially by adding multiple levels, difficulty settings, and multiplayer functionality. 


## See below for Phoenix basics: 

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
