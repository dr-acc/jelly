# Jelly
Welcome! Jelly is an Elixir learning game featuring the eponymous character "Jelly" and her trusted mount, Bert. 
## Game Play
Jelly's Game Play Area takes up most of the viewer's browser window. Riding Bert, Jelly can move to most places on the browser window screen using the arrow keys (up, down, right, or left). 
### Follow Instructions in the Instruction Area
During game play, one question or challenge at a time is displayed near the top of the screen, in the Instruction Area. Corresponding answer choice options are displayed on the Game Board. At least one answer on the Game Board is correct; there may be more than one correct answer, as well as incorrect answers.

### Choosing an Answer
Players navigate to the Game Board square containing their answer of choice, pressing the "spacebar" to submit that answer as a solution to the question. If the answer is correct, Bert celebrates with a scream of fire, stamping the square with the explosion emoji: üí•. But beware: incorrect solutions are marked with the snowflake emoji: ‚ùÑÔ∏è, marking the space on behalf of the Evil Snow Snail. 

It resembles a tic-tac-toe board and winning a  game entails achieving three marked squares in a row, column, or diagonal. 

## Future Directions
To manage project scope, this project was conceptualized as a single game, but additional features could significantly enhance and expand this project in the future, especially by adding multiple levels, difficulty settings, and multiplayer functionality. 


## See below for Phoenix basics: 

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
